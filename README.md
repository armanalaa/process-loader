A tool for Loading and Sharing Processes and resources for the management and development of the Smart City.

## Features
- Lightweight and fast

The Snap4City platform is based on components from the Km4City framework and this GitHub repository. Please read the documentation on [Snap4City.org](https://www.snap4city.org) to understand which components you need to install according to your goals.

Documentation is accessible from:
- [https://www.snap4city.org](https://www.snap4city.org)
- [https://www.km4city.org](https://www.km4city.org)

Most of the Snap4City components can be provided in the form of an appliance. Appliances are essentially Virtual Machines that you can execute on your premises, fully configured with full access at the level of Root/Admin. The VMs primarily use Linux-like operating systems. For appliance inquiries, please contact Paolo Nesi at [Paolo.nesi@unifi.it](mailto:Paolo.nesi@unifi.it).
